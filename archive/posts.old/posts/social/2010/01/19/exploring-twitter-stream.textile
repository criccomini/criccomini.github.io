h5. DATA SIZE

747,349 tweets in ~10.5 hours for a total raw size of 925M. 

h5. GEOLOCATION DATA

1,723 geo tagged tweets out of 747,349 total tweets (0.23%). 

h5. URLS

151,858 tweets with a url out of 747,349 total tweets (0.20%). 

By the way, an easy way to unshorten URLs is to use Python's urllib2.urlopen(url).geturl() command. Works like a charm, though I'm not sure if it fetches the entire page. I hav e a sneaking suspicion that it does.

h5. TF-IDF

The first step in determining related tweets for me was to simply determine what topics I was interested in. I initially applied TF-IDF to my tweet stream to determine the most important keywords. This turned out to work fairly well. I got keywords such as Hadoop, Pig, AsterData, etc. I also got a few names of people that I had retweeted. In addition I got some stop words (interesting, bit, etc). I removed some of the stop words, and filtered out the names, and the resulting list was fairly decent. 

I then iterated over ever tweet in the twitter stream, and computed the cosine similarity between the tweet, and my feed. This failed miserably. The top tweets for me were one word tweets such as "PIg___", "data", etc. Unsurprisingly, cosine similarity just doesn't hold up well for small documents, such as tweets. 

This is as far as I've gotten, since I had to head back into work, but I have a few more tricks to try. Ideas are always welcome.
