    <p>This coding tutorial shows how to develop a login screen for the iPhone. I walk through the complete process of creating and designing a basic iPhone screen. Concepts include the Xcode IDE, Objective C, the iPhone Cocoa UI SDK, Controllers, Outlets, and more.</p>

    <div style="font-size: .7em; color: #bbb;">27 Nov 2008</div>
    <p>My interest in mobile platforms lately has turned to disappointment.

Very little is ready for primetime, which is a huge headache for developers and users alike.</p>
