    <p>One of YARN's exciting new features is its support for Cgroups in YARN containers. This post shows how to setup and use Cgroups with YARN 2.0.5-alpha.</p>

    <p>It is sometimes difficult for SQL users to learn Pig because their mind is used to working in SQL. In this tutorial, examples of various SQL statements are shown, and then translated into Pig statements.</p>

    <div style="font-size: .7em; color: #bbb;">13 Nov 2009</div>
    <p>I recently found the need to sort by value (intead of key) in Hadoop. I've seen some comments that call this a "secondary sort". Essentially, I wanted the reducer's values iterator to be sorted. There seem to be almost *no* docs, tutorials, or examples (that I could find) on the net for this.</p>

    <p>My notes on the Hadoop Summit '09 conference in Santa Clara this year. The conference was very energetic, and Hadoop's momentum is undeniable.</p>
