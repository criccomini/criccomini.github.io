h5. NOTES

By default, BlackBerry buttons don't consume clicks. This means, when a user clicks on a button, the app menu also pops up. To fix this, use ButtonField myButton = new ButtonField("ok", ButtonField.CONSUME_CLICK); 

To push a new screen onto the screen stack, use UiApplication.getuiapplication().pushScreen(&lt;your screen instance&gt;); 

When adding UI elements to a MainScreen, do it in onDisplay(), not the constructor. If you do it in the constructor, you will get strange behavior. One example of this would be buttons not being enabled when the screen displays.
