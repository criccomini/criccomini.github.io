  <h2 style="color: #2E8AD1;">Hadoop Summit 2009</h2>
  <div style="font-size: .7em; color: #bbb;">13 Jun 2009</div>
  <p>My notes on the Hadoop Summit &#8216;09 conference in Santa Clara this year. The conference was very energetic, and Hadoop&#8217;s momentum is undeniable.</p>
  <ul>
	<li>The &#8220;The Growing Hadoop Community&#8221; talk was an eye opening experience. Given the buzz on Hadoop, I had figured it was much more mature than it actually is.
	<ul>
		<li>In 2007, there were only 3 companies listed in the &#8220;powered by&#8221; page. In 2008, Facebook was added, as well as ~20 other big names.</li>
	</ul></li>
	<li><span class="caps">ANSI</span> compliant <span class="caps">SQL</span> is coming for Pig in the next month or two (!)</li>
	<li>Oozie (job manager similar to Azkaban) is not impressive.</li>
	<li>Sun is coming out with an <span class="caps">AWS</span> clone (and cloned pricing model! &#8230; )</li>
	<li><span class="caps">IBM</span> is trying to be relevant with a strange project called M2 that uses Hadoop to crawl/visualize data sets.</li>
	<li>Cloudera is really trying to do a lot for the Hadoop community. They were very conspicuous at the conference.
	<ul>
		<li>Cloudera + <span class="caps">EBS</span> <span class="caps">AWS</span> image is available (and apparently pretty fast compared to S3)</li>
		<li>Highlighted Sqoop (<span class="caps">SQL</span> &#8594; Hadoop) app</li>
		<li>Big focus on binary packages for projects</li>
		<li>Three presentations: 2 in Administration track, 1 in Intro. They seem to recognize that friction is coming from ops teams. Attempting to show how to integrate it, or bypass ops (cloud hosting).</li>
	</ul></li>
	<li>There seems to be a war brewing between Hive and Pig. They really don&#8217;t seem to get along too well.</li>
	<li>Yahoo! is releasing their own Hadoop binary packages (like Cloudera).</li>
	<li>No one really seemed to be able to give me a good answer as to what Cascading is and how it fits in with workflow/job managers. It&#8217;s also GPL&#8217;d, which means a few people are not too happy with it.</li>
	<li>EC2 + S3 for Hadoop is really a great solution.
	<ul>
		<li><span class="caps">EMR</span> is interesting, but a bit limiting for our use case (only can workflow Hadoop jobs). Also, hard to integrate with our staging (non <span class="caps">EMR</span>) cluster.</li>
		<li>People are annoyed with 1hr block pricing. Minimum payment blocks are one hour.</li>
		<li>Persisting data from EC2 can be done in two ways: (1) Save to S3 or (2) Save to <span class="caps">EBS</span>. When new nodes are brought up, they just pull data from S3/<span class="caps">EBS</span>, and begin running.</li>
		<li>Persisting data with Aster involves extra step of loading data into temporary node, and running ncluster_loader to insert the data into your cluster.</li>
		<li>ShareThis (Paco) was very prominent. They leverage EC2 for just about everything (including running Aster in the cloud).</li>
	</ul></li>
	<li>Hbase is focusing on performance now. Seeing pretty big gains. Heard &#8220;Can I issue <span class="caps">PIG</span>/<span class="caps">SQL</span> queries on Hbase?&#8221; question 3 times, and also saw it on Pig mailing list.</li>
	<li>Future proofing map reduce talk was basically a Yahoo! VP explaining why it was a good thing that he broke all of our Hadoop jobs. (0.20 changes)</li>
	<li>Greenplum was never mentioned at ScaleCamp or Hadoop Summit (that I heard). Aster was acknowledged by Hive/Facebook team as another solution (although Netizza was as well &#8230; ).</li>
</ul>
